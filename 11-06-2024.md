### A game engine
I want to make an engine to play a board game. Chess sounds like a scary start, since I don't have any experience with this, I'm going to start with Tic-Tac-Toe. In the future I might try with something like Connect 4 or Mancala.

### Setting up the game
After about 100 lines of code I have the game working in the Python terminal. I considered using C for efficiency, but I decided to keep it easier for myself for now

Here's my main file
```
import game, input, display, bot

board = [[0 for i in range(3)] for j in range(3)]
gameStatus = 0
turn = 1

while gameStatus == 0:
    display.printBoard(board)
    if turn == 1: # // 1: Human plays first, 2: Bot plays first
        move = input.askMove(board, turn)
    else:
        move = bot.botMove(board, turn)
    game.makeMove(board, move, turn)
    gameStatus = game.checkWinner(board, move)
    turn = turn % 2 + 1

display.printBoard(board)
display.printResult(gameStatus)
```

### Building the Bot

So I know engines for more complex games evaluate positions using a certain depth to try and make the best move and this was my first plan. However, I quickly realized that Tic-Tac-Toe there's not many possible positions, about 9! if I'm correct. (That's 9 factorial not "NINE" as my calc 2 teacher would say). 362,880 positions should be fairly easy for a computer to go through, so instead of limiting the depth of my bot, I'm going to use recursion to evaluate positions until a position is fully evaluated.

I came up with this evaluation function that seems to work
```
def evalPosition(board, turn):  
    # // Generate all legal moves  
    legalMoves = []  
    for testMove in range(10):  
        if isLegalMove(board, testMove):  
            legalMoves.append(testMove)  
    adv = turn % 2 + 1 
    # // Keeps track of who has the advantage
    # // Assumes worst case for start  
    for testMove in legalMoves:  
        # // Iterating through the legal moves for this position  
        localBoard = [row[:] for row in board]  
        game.makeMove(localBoard, testMove, turn)  
        winner = game.checkWinner(localBoard, testMove)  
        # // 0 -> Game in Progress, 1 & 2 -> Winner, 3 -> Draw  
        if winner == turn:  
            # // Player has advantage if it can win in one move  
            return turn  
        elif winner == 3:  
            # // If a move can force a draw, the worst case is a draw  
            if adv == turn % 2 + 1:  
                adv = 0  
        elif winner == 0:  
            # // If the game is ongoing, 
            # // the position is evaluated further
            nextEval = evalPosition(localBoard, turn % 2 + 1)
            # // Evaluation is updated if it is better  
            if adv == turn % 2 + 1 or nextEval == turn:  
                adv = nextEval  
        # // The other player cannot win on this turn,
        # // and if it's a draw adv can stay at 0  
    return adv
```

Finally the bot will call the evaluation function for all legal moves and play one with the highest evaluation.

### Reflection
I know for any game that's more complicated I'll have to put more thought into the evaluation function than just going through all the possible moves, but for my first time doing that and doing it completely on my own, I'm glad with the result.

It's well past midnight so ironically I hope I don't sleep through CS Lab tomorrow.
